# Warehouse Management of BRAG’s Online Web Store

BRAG Warehouse Operations and WMS Database. Using this project, user will be able to add information about new customers, their orders for items in BRAG’s inventory, and vendors who supply these items to replenish BRAG’s inventory.
BRAG’s warehouse management system (WMS) controls key operations with its warehouse and is supported by a backend database hosted by a RDBMS such as MS SQL Server.
The WMS database should store data that is needed to support the warehouse operations of receiving items from vendors to replenish on-hand inventory, the stocking of items, and the picking of items to fulfil customer orders.
